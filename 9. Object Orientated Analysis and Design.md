## Introduction

The 3 Steps of Good Software according to Headfirst books:
1. Make sure your application does what the customer wants
2. Apply OO prionciples and design
3. Strive for a Maintainable and reusable design

## Goals of OOP Design

1. Develop Loosly Coupled Code
- This means your objects are independent of eachother, a by product of delegation

2. Develop Robust Code
- Fragile code Breaks easily

3. Develop Maintainable code
- Updates shouldn't be required in many places should a minor change be needed


<a name="encapsulation"></a>
## Encapsulation

The practice of bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class.
For example if we have a class that uses string comparisons to search an inventory, other classes could also need to use these strings, if the items in the inventory ever change, we would have to update them in many places. Instead what we can do is bundle them together un their own class, and create an enum, so should it ever change we update it in one place.

Encapsulation allows you to group your application into logical parts.

## SOLID Principles

Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob came up with the SOLID principles for OOP

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Definition: A class should have only one reason to change; in other words, it should have only one job or responsibility. This principle ensures that each class is focused on a single task, making it easier to maintain and extend without affecting other parts of the code.
Benefit: Helps to create classes that are easier to understand and modify because each class has only one concern.
Example: A class Invoice should not handle both the calculation of the invoice and sending it via email. Instead, separate classes should handle these responsibilities.
2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
Definition: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its existing code.
Benefit: Promotes code reusability and reduces the risk of introducing bugs when adding new features.
Example: You can add new types of shapes (like Circle or Rectangle) by extending a base Shape class, without modifying the existing code in the Shape class.
3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
Definition: Objects of a subclass should be substitutable for objects of the parent class without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a derived class should be able to replace its base class without introducing errors or unexpected behavior.
Benefit: Ensures that inheritance is used properly and that subclass objects can stand in for superclass objects without disrupting the system's behavior.
Example: If you have a class Bird and a subclass Penguin, you should not have Penguin fail in places where Bird is expected (e.g., methods that assume the ability to fly, which would break for penguins).
4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
Definition: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of a large, all-encompassing interface, multiple smaller, more specific interfaces should be created.
Benefit: Reduces the side effects of changing a large interface, encourages smaller, more focused interfaces, and avoids forcing clients to implement methods they don't need.
Example: If you have an interface Printer with methods print(), scan(), and fax(), a Scanner class should not be forced to implement fax(). Instead, separate Scanner and Printer interfaces can be created.
5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Furthermore, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle helps to invert the direction of dependency between high-level and low-level components, making the system more flexible.
Benefit: Encourages loose coupling between components, making it easier to change the low-level implementation without affecting the high-level modules.
Example: Instead of a Database class directly depending on a specific MySQLDatabase implementation, both the Database class and the MySQLDatabase class can depend on an abstraction (an interface or abstract class), such as DatabaseConnection, allowing you to switch implementations easily.
