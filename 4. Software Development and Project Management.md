## Software Development Methodologies

A software development methodology is a structured approach used to plan, develop, test, and deploy software projects.
Various Exist...

**Waterfall**:

A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. It includes stages like requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It’s often used for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change.

**Agile**:

An iterative and incremental approach that promotes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, focus on delivering small, workable increments of the project through continuous iterations called 
_sprints_.

- **Scrum**:

A specific framework within Agile, Scrum organizes development into time-boxed sprints (usually 2-4 weeks) with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team) and ceremonies (daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives).

- **Kanban**:

Another Agile framework, Kanban focuses on visualizing the workflow, limiting work in progress, and managing flow to improve efficiency. It uses a Kanban board to track tasks from start to completion.

**Lean**:

Derived from Lean manufacturing, this methodology emphasizes minimizing waste, maximizing value, and continuous improvement. Lean principles can be applied to various stages of software development to enhance efficiency and productivity.

**DevOps**:

A cultural and technical movement that integrates development and operations to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and continuously deliver high-quality software. DevOps practices include continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code.

**Extreme Programming (XP)**:

An Agile methodology that emphasizes customer satisfaction, continuous feedback, and technical excellence. XP practices include pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), and frequent releases.

**Spiral**:

A risk-driven approach that combines elements of both iterative and Waterfall methodologies. It involves repeated cycles (spirals) of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. It’s suitable for complex and high-risk projects.
