## Introduction


## 1. Creating a Requirements List

The requester generally decides _what_ the program does while you decide _how_ it works.

List their requirements on a basic level



## 2. Create Use cases

Write down a list of use cases (Steps a system takes to make something happen).

A good use case has:
- Clear value
- Start and a Stop
- External Initiator 

List these taking their requirements into account.
You would have a main path and Alternative Paths

___
**EXAMPLE Use Case: User Login**

Main Path (Basic Flow)

1. **User navigates to the login page**  
   The system displays the login form with fields for **username** and **password**, along with a **Login** button.

2. **User enters valid credentials**  
   The user inputs their correct **username** and **password** in the respective fields.

3. **User submits the login form**  
   The user clicks the **Login** button.

4. **System validates the credentials**  
   The system checks the username and password against the stored credentials in the database.  
   - If the credentials are correct, the system proceeds to the next step.

5. **User is authenticated and granted access**  
   The system logs the user in and redirects them to the **dashboard** or home page.

6. **User accesses authenticated features**  
   The system allows the user to interact with features that require authentication (e.g., viewing profile, making transactions, etc.).

---

The alternate paths can be written seperatly or as sub steps for the main path.


The use case should describe what a system does to achieve a customers requirement.


## 3. Check Requirements against your Use cases

Check your use cases meet the requirements

## 4. Textual Analysis and UML diagrams

At this point you can carry out textual analysis which is looking at your requirements list and you use cases and analysing the nouns and verbs to determine classes and methods needed.

You can use UML to illustrate this.
