## Git  Config

### Files 
`/etc/gitconfig` contains values for every user on the system which can be edited with the `--system` option

`~/.gitconfig` or `~./config/git/config` files are specific to the user accessible with the `--global` option

`.git/config` is repository specific

`git config --list`

Each level above overides values from previous.


`git config` - lets you get and set configuration variables

`git commit --amend --no-edit` - for if you want to keep the same commit message

---

## Get/Create repo
2 ways to get a repo
1. Take an Existing Project and import it into Git

### Initialize

Initialize the Repo when starting to track an existing repo using git

`git init` - Initialise git repo from current directory



2. Clone an Existing Repo from another server

### Cloneing

Git receives a full copy of all the data, every version of every file in the history of the project.
Initalizrs a .git directory inside it checks out a working copy of the latest version.


`git clone <url> <directory>` - clones a git repository to your local computer

## Tracking Changes
**Tracked Files** are files that were in your last snapshot
- Unmodified
- Modified
- Staged

**Untracked** files are everything else


<br>

### Status Changes and Logging
`git status` - Used to check the status of your files

`git status -s` - short status

`git diff` - view differences of your working directory and your staging are ( shows unstaged changes only unless --staged used)
`git diff --cached` - see what you've staged so far
untracked files have an ?? after them.
Files added have an A next to them
Files modified have an M next to them.
`git diff --staged` see what you have staged will go in your next commit

`git log` - check commit history , `--stat` shows statistics, `--pretty` changes the format. `-p` shows the difference in each commit
`--pretty=oneline`
`--pretty=short`
`--pretty=full`
`--pretty=fuller`
`--graph=oneline`
`--graph=format` 

`-n` limits the output
`--since` `--until` - time limiting options
`-s <string>` shows commits that 
<br>

### Staging/Index Area

`git add .` - adds all of the files inside the current directory folder to the staging area

`git add <file>`- If you modify the file after staging you will need to stage again.

`git reset HEAD <file>` - to unstage a file
<br>

### Ignoring Files

`.gitignore` is a file you can add patterns to to ignore file names
for example...
```
cat .gitignore 
*.[fileextension]
*~

```
This ignores files with a ~ in the name or certain extensions
Examples of git ignore file patterns
https://github.com/github/gitignore

## Commit changes

`git commit` - used to create a snapshot of current changes, this creates a SHA-1 hash as an identifier, this snapshot can be passed around and used by other people.

`git commit -m “commit name/description”` - commit with a commit message

`git commit --amend --no-edit` - amend commit message , dont change it from the last

`git commit -a` - skip the staging area and automatically stage files when commiting

`git commit --ammend` - takes your staging area and uses it for the commit

Anything committed in git can almost always be recovered
___
<br>

## Remove files

`$ rm file.cs` - removes the file, making it an **unstaged** change

`git rm` - stages the file removal

When you next commit, the file will be removed from your commit.
If modified and added to the index already, then the `-f` option has to be used.`-2` limits the output to last 2

`git rm --cached <filename>` - only remove the file from the staging area but keep the file locally(untrack the file)
___
<br>

## Moving Files

Git doesnt explicitly track file movement but it will pick up renames and changes.

`$ git mv <file_from> <file_to>`
___
<br>


## Checkout / Switch 

`git checkout` - switch between different versions of your project

You can switch :
* Files
* Branches
* Commits


Checking out can overwrite uncommited changes.
Deleting files can delete from your working directory.
Checking out a branch with conflicting changes can cause merge confilicts.
Cheking our a commit without checking out a branch can put you in a detached head state.

## Working with remotes

`git remote` - lists the shortnames of each remote `-v` shows URLs for these remotes

`git remote add <shortname> <url>` - you can add a nickname to a remote so you can call upon it

`git remote rename`- change a remotes shortname

`git remote rm` - remove a remote branch

`git remote show:` - used to inspect a remote, lists URL and tracking branch information



`git fetch <remotename>` - fetch remote branches to make them available locally. It doesn't automatically Merge it.

`git pull`- fetches data from server originally clonded from and automatically tries to merge it into the code currently working on

`git push <remotename> <branchname>` - push your local branch up to your remote repository

Your push can be rejected if you have not pulled prior to merge any changes to the remote you are pushing to.


## Tagging

Tag specific points in history as being important.

`git tag`- list tags


Two main types
* annotated
* lightweight


### Annotated

`git tag -a <tagname> -m 'my version'` - adds an annotated tage with a message

`git show <tagname>` - displays tag information

### Lightweight

Same as annotated but without the -m , -a , -s options

`git show <tagname>` - displays tag information but wont show extra tag information like annotated

### Tagging commits

`git tag -a <tagname> <commitchecksum>`

### Pushing Tags

`git push --tags` - remote branch

___
<br>


## Aliases

Commands can be infered using aliases

`git config --global alias.co checkout`
`git config --global alias.br branch`
`git config --global alias.ci commit`
`git config --global alias.st status`

`git config --global alias.visual "gitk"` -! mark can be used to alias external commands.


## Branching

Generally the approach to branches have a master branch, and parallel proposed, develop or test branches. Topic branches are short lived branches.
Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged.
Stageing the file:
* creates a SHA-1
* stores version of file in repo(blobs)
* adds checksum to staging area

Commiting a file:
* creates checksums for each subdirectory
* stores those tree objects in the git repository

A branch is simply a lightweight movable pointer to commit

`git init` - creates branch named `master` as default

`git branch` - list branches, * character indicates that which is checked out
    `--merged` `--no-merged` filters this

`git branch testing` - creates a new pointer to the commit currently on. Doesnt switch to this branch only creates it. 

`HEAD` is gits pointer to the branch your currently on

`git branch -d` - delete branch

`git reset --hard origin/<branchname>` - Reset your local branch to match the remote branch


### Switching Branching

`git checkout` - switch to an existing branch

### Merging

When you merge two branches with different changes to the same part of a file, git cannot merge it cleanly and you get merge confilicts.
Conflict resoluton markers are added to the files with conflicts
You can edit a file to view the conflict resoluton markers
Run `git add` to mark as resolved
A merge commit is created when branches are merged without conflicts

`git merge <branchname>` - merges branchname into that which is checked out

`git mergetool` - graphical tool to resolve merge issues

# Common Workflows

## Reset Local Master Branch to match Remote

`git checkout master` - make sure your on the local master branch

`git fetch origin` - fetch latest changes to remote (origin is default remote repo name)

`git reset --hard origin/master` - reset local branch to match remote


## Remove Untracked Files

`git clean -n` - preview untracked files to be deleted

`git clean -f` - Removes untracked files (-d includes direcories, -x includes ignored files)



# Other Commands


`git add .` - adds all of the files inside the current directory folder to the staging area

`git status` - Shows previous stages and staged files ready for a commit

`git diff` - check the differences between the working directory and the staging area


`git remote add origin <URL here>` - Specify the URL of the remote repo. Adds a remote repository called origin, located on the path specified

`git remote -v` - checks whether the remote add worked, v stands for verbose

`git push -u origin master` - pushes the master branch to the remote repository labelled origin


`git show HEAD` -the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit.

`git checkout HEAD <filename>` - will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit

`git checkout <filename>` - shortcut command that does the same as above

`git reset HEAD <filename>` - unstage that file from the staging area.This command resets the file in the staging area to be the same as the HEAD commit. It does not discard file changes from the working directory, it just removes them from the staging area.

`git reset <commit SHA>` - Sets HEAD to the previous commit stated.
This command works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit. The SHA is the unique value given to each commit viewed with git log.

`git stash` - “stashing” your local work temporarily in order to update a previous commit and later on retrieve your work.  Allows you to get back to a clean commit point with a synchronised working tree, and avoid losing your local changes in the process.

`git stash pop` -  retrieve the code you were working on previously, you can “pop” the work that was stored when you used git stash.

`git stash list` -  shows what we have stashed

`git log` - shows log of commits with SHA

`git log --online`  - shows the list of commits in one line format.

`git log -S “<keyword>”` displays a list of commits that contain the keyword in the message. In the screenshot below, we use `git log -S "Add"` to find any commits with “Add” in the message.

`git log --online --graph` - --graph -  Displays a visual representation of how the branches and commits were created in order to help you make sense of your repository history. When used alone, the description can be very lengthy, so you can combine the command with --oneline in order to shorten the description.
`--amend` flag is extremely useful when updating a commit, it allows you to correct mistakes and edit commits easily instead of creating a completely new one.
git commit --amend -to update your previous commit, Git actually does is replace the whole previous commit. For this reason, when you execute the command git commit --amend, your terminal editor asks you to update your commit message.



`git merge - m “” <branch to merge>` - Merges the specified branch

`git switch main` - switch to main branch


### How to Push code to git hub repo Initial:
Create a local repo and push it to the remote repo
1. Head to your [gitrepo] folder (any location where you store git repos)
2. `mkdir` (Make directory) and call it your repo name or **project.repo**
3. Initialise the LOCAL directory as a GIT repository using `git init`
4. Stage files for your first commit by adding files to the staging areas using `git add .`
5. Commit the files you have staged in your local repository using `git commit -m “commit name"`
- You may have to use vim when setting your commit message if unspecified `ESC` then `:wq` to save and quit
6. Specify the remote repo URL, use `git r emote add origin <URL here>`
7. Push the code in you local repository to GitHub using `git push -u origin`
(Initially you would not have an upstream branch set, so will have to use `git push --set-upstream origin main` this pushes the current branch and sets the remote as upstream)


### How to clone a remote repository to your local machine:
1. Navigate to the right directory you want to clone the repository to
2. Use `git clone <url>`


### How to git pull when git won’t overwrite local files because they have unique changes

If you are sure that you don't need them anymore, you can discard your local changes completely:
`git reset --hard`

If you also have untracked / new files, you will have to use the "git clean" command to get rid of these, too:
`git clean -fd`


Struggling with Branches
Git branch - See what branch your on
Switch to main with git checkout main
If branch main docent exist locally you will need to run git branch main
You can then add your file and push to origin main
