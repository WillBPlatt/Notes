# Programming Fundamentals

## Logical Operations

Three logical operations:
- Conjunction(left and right) - TRUE if both values are true - AND
- Disjunction(left or right) - FALSE if both values are false, otherwise TRUE OR
- Negation(not right) - TRUE if false , FALSE if true NOT

Negation is right-associative and has higher precedence than conjunction. 
Conjunction and disjunction are left-associative.

## Expressions

In programming, an expression is a combination of variables, constants, operators, and functions that the programming language evaluates to produce a value.
These could be :
- Literal Expressions (declares a literal value)
- Variable Expressions (is a variable)
- Arithmatic Expressions (involves Maths!)
- Logical Expressions (involves logical operators)
- Compound Expressions (multiple expressions combined)

No neeed to learn every possible type, the names can be ambiguous.

## Short Circuits

When working with boolean and expressions the evaluation of the code can short-circuit as to only evaluate part of the code and skip the rest.

This can work to our advantage when working with errors.
See the below python:

Because we are checking the denoiminator is not equal to 0, it can work to our advantage. The rest of the code will not be evalueated unless this is true.
The left operand of the conjunction guarantees that the right
operand is only evaluated if the fraction has a defined value. 


## Precedence
Precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions.
Similar to BIDMASS in mathematics, each programming language has rules for precedence and what operations will be evaluated/applied first.


## Associativity

The order in which operations are applied when they have the same precedence. 
**Right Associativity** - Operators evaluated from right to left

**Left Associativity** - Operators evaluated from left to right.

```python
# Operators have the same precedence, due to left associativity they're evaluated left to right
result = 6 * 3 / 2
print(result)  # Output: 9.0

``` 



# Best Practices

1. Avoid writing algorithms that depend on the short-circuit behaviour.
2. Check short-circuits to handle errors and or confirm input values are evaluated first.
