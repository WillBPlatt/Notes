# Programming Fundamentals

## Logical Operations

Three logical operations:
- Conjunction(left and right) - TRUE if both values are true - AND
- Disjunction(left or right) - FALSE if both values are false, otherwise TRUE OR
- Negation(not right) - TRUE if false , FALSE if true NOT

Negation is right-associative and has higher precedence than conjunction. 
Conjunction and disjunction are left-associative.

## Expressions

In programming, an expression is a combination of variables, constants, operators, and functions that the programming language evaluates to produce a value.
These could be :
- Literal Expressions (declares a literal value)
- Variable Expressions (is a variable)
- Arithmatic Expressions (involves Maths!)
- Logical Expressions (involves logical operators)
- Compound Expressions (multiple expressions combined)

No neeed to learn every possible type, the names can be ambiguous.

## Short Circuits

When working with boolean and expressions the evaluation of the code can short-circuit as to only evaluate part of the code and skip the rest.

This can work to our advantage when working with errors.
See the below python:

Because we are checking the denoiminator is not equal to 0, it can work to our advantage. The rest of the code will not be evalueated unless this is true.
The left operand of the conjunction guarantees that the right
operand is only evaluated if the fraction has a defined value. 


## Precedence
Precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions.
Similar to BIDMASS in mathematics, each programming language has rules for precedence and what operations will be evaluated/applied first.


## Associativity

The order in which operations are applied when they have the same precedence. 
**Right Associativity** - Operators evaluated from right to left

**Left Associativity** - Operators evaluated from left to right.

```python
# Operators have the same precedence, due to left associativity they're evaluated left to right
result = 6 * 3 / 2
print(result)  # Output: 9.0

```

## Imperative

## Functional

### Concepts specific to functional

**Pure Functions:**

A pure function always produces the same output for the same input, and has no side effects (i.e., it doesn't modify any external state).
This makes pure functions easier to reason about and test, as their behavior is predictable.

**Immutability:**

Data is treated as immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it's created.
Instead of modifying existing data, new data is created with the desired changes.
This helps avoid unintended side effects and makes it easier to reason about the state of the program.

**Higher-Order Functions:**

Functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.
This allows for powerful abstractions and code reuse.   

**Recursion:**

A technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
Recursion is often used in functional programming to avoid the use of loops, which can be more difficult to reason about in the presence of mutable state.
```python
def length(items: list) -> int:
    """Return the number of objects in the list."""
    if is_empty(items):
    return 0
    else:
    return length(tail(items)) + 1
```

For a recursive definition and the corresponding algorithm to be correct, there must be a **base case** at which the recursion stops and the recurrence relation must progress towards the base case by decreasing the input.

When the recursive call is the last operation in a function, it’s called tail **recursion.**

Functions with more than one argument may require several of them being decreased or being checked for a base case.

A single-recursion algorithm only recurs over one part; a multiple-recursion algorithm recurs over two or more parts.

Recursion, even without tail optimisation, adds a very small overhead. 

**Lazy Evaluation:**

Expressions are only evaluated when their values are needed.
This can lead to performance improvements, as unnecessary computations are avoided.

**Declarative Style:**

Functional programs focus on what to compute, rather than how to compute it.
This can make functional programs more concise and easier to understand.

# Types of Algorithms

## Divide and conquer

Divide and conquer is a problem-solving strategy that divides the input into two or more parts, solves (conquers) the smaller problem instances then combines the solutions for the parts to obtain the solution for the original input.

## Decrease and conquer

A decrease-and-conquer algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that creates only one
smaller part or that creates multiple parts but only solves one of them.
A decrease-and-conquer algorithm only solves one smaller problem instance. If the input is small enough, the solution is
computed directly.
## Binary Search

A binary search is a generate-and-test and a decrease-and-conquer algorithm: it generates the
middle element of a sorted sequence and tests if it’s the sought item. If it isn’t, the search
conquers either the left or the right half. Binary search keeps halving the search space after
testing each candidate, until it finds a solution or the search space is empty. 
# Best Practices

1. Avoid writing algorithms that depend on the short-circuit behaviour.
2. Check short-circuits to handle errors and or confirm input values are evaluated first.
