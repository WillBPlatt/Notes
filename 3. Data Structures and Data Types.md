## <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Introduction</span>

A Data Structure is a the word we use to describe a format for organising and working with data. 
Because the implementation varys across languages, we call them **Abstract Data Types (ADT)**

It's important to note here that programming languages can have their own data structures such as a tuple in python, however the focus of this note is to look at the more complex/fundamental structures you often see when programming across all languages.

**Whats the key differences between a data structure and date type?**

When we say data structures do not "implement" data types, we generally mean that data structures are not directly responsible for defining the fundamental nature and operations of primitive data types (like integers, booleans, etc.). However, in more complex cases, especially with built-in types like `string` and `List<T>`, the underlying implementations of these higher-level data types **utilize** data structures.

So essentially you don't think of it as data structures implement types but instead types utilize data structures howver you wouldn't be incorrect in saying, the implementation of an Abstract Data Type (ADT) can be considered its data structure.

For Built in Data Types such as `string`, the class that defines the string type is arguably the **data structure**.( String data type utilizes the string data structure)
For Custom Data Types such as a `map`, this custom Data type is implemented by a **data structure** we define, utilizing built in types.

Abstraction vs Implementation: Data types are abstract concepts defining the nature of data, while data structures are concrete implementations to manage and store that data.

Usage Scope: Data types are foundational elements provided by programming languages, whereas data structures are more advanced constructs used to optimize data management and operations.


**Data Types:**
Primitive data types are NOT implemented with classes
Complex/Reference data types ARE typically implemented with classes

## <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Linear vs Non-Linear</span>

The terms linear and non-linear refer to how the elements within the data structure are organized and related to each other.

### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Linear</span> -
Linear Arrangement: Elements are arranged in a sequential manner, one after the other.
Memory: Typically, linear data structures are stored in contiguous memory locations, although there are exceptions like linked lists.
Traversal: You can traverse all elements in a single run, from start to end.
Examples: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Non-Linear</span> -

Hierarchical Arrangement: Elements are organized in a hierarchical manner, not in a sequence.
Memory: Non-linear data structures can be stored in non-contiguous memory locations.
Traversal: Traversing elements may require multiple passes or a hierarchical approach (like depth-first or breadth-first traversal).
Examples: Trees, graphs, maps, and sets.

### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">1. Primitive Data Structures</span>

<span style="color:red">**Integer:**</span> A whole number without decimals used for counting and basic math operations. \
<span style="color:red">**Float:**</span> A number that can have decimal points, used for more precise numerical calculations.\
<span style="color:red">**Character:**</span> A single letter, number, or symbol that represents one text character.\

<span style="color:red">**Pointer:**</span> A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.



### 2. Linear Data Structures

#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Arrays</span>

Arrays can be _Static_ or _Dynamic_. 

A **static** array is a data structure that stores a fixed-length sequence contiguously in memory, generally with the same number of bytes per item. Arrays keep all data (or pointers to data) in contiguous memory to support constant-time access. 
 
A **dynamic** array is a flexible array that can grow or shrink in size automatically as you add or remove elements.  A dynamic array is a data type that adds a resize operation to a static array data structure.  Most modern programming languages include built-in dynamic array implementations, though they might call them different things. Note even if thats the case you can still implement them manually.

A **multidimensional** array is an array that contains more than one dimension to represent data. It can be thought of as an array of arrays, where each element in the primary array can be another array. Dimension refers to the number of indices needed to access a specific element within an array. A two-dimensional array is essentially a table with rows and columns. A three-dimensional array can be visualized as a cube or a collection of tables.

#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Linked Lists</span>

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements, called nodes, are stored in a sequence. Linked lists are different from arrays in that they do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node points to the next node, creating a chain-like structure.

1. **Singly Linked List**
Each node points to the next node.
```
[Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> null
```

2. **Doubly Linked List**
Each node has two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node.(Allows Traversal in both directions)
```
null <- [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] -> null
```
3. **Circular Linked List**
Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
```
[Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] (points back to the first node)
```

#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Stacks</span>

Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. Computationally, a stack is a restricted sequence in which new items are added to and removed from only one end of the sequence. Like a stack of plates, you can only add or remove from the top. Key operations are push (add) and pop (remove).
Stacks can be **Linked List based Stacks** or **Array Based Stacks**.

A stack can be considered both an Abstract Data Type (ADT) and a Data Structure, depending on the context in which we discuss it.

* new 
* size
* push
* pop
* peek

Theres a special stack called a call stack which is is essentially a specialized stack designed for managing function calls. Each item on the call stack is called a stack frame. Most Interpreters have built in call stacks which reserve a limited amount of memory for them. If many functions are waiting for others to complete, then the stack may get full, which leads to an error.

#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Queues</span>
A Queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front, like people waiting in line.
Here are the different queue implementations:

1. **Array-based Queue**
Uses a fixed-size array with front and rear pointers to track elements, but wastes space as elements are dequeued unless elements are shifted.

2. **Linked List-based Queue**
Implements queue using a linked list where front points to head and rear to tail, allowing dynamic size but using more memory for pointers.

3. **Circular Queue**
Uses an array in circular fashion where rear wraps around to start, efficiently reusing space and solving the wastage problem of regular array queues.

4. **Double-ended Queue (Deque)**
Allows insertion and deletion at both ends, providing more flexibility than standard queues and can be implemented using either arrays or linked lists.


**Example in Python:**
To create a singly linked list - Create a Node class to represent each element in the list, and then a LinkedList class to manage the list itself. 
```python

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # The data value of the node
        self.next = None  # Reference to the next node, initially None



class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None  # Head of the list, initially None

    def append(self, data):
        """Add a node with data at the end of the list."""
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node  # If list is empty, new node is head
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:  # Traverse to the end of the list
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node  # Point last node to the new node

    def display(self):
        """Print all elements in the linked list."""
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        """Insert a node at the beginning of the list."""
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head  # New node points to the current head
        self.head = new_node  # Head is now the new node

    def delete_by_value(self, value):
        """Delete the first node with the given value."""
        current = self.head

        # If the head itself holds the value to be deleted
        if current and current.data == value:
            self.head = current.next  # Move head to the next node
            current = None  # Free up the old head
            return

        # Search for the node to be deleted, keeping track of the previous node
        prev = None
        while current and current.data != value:
            prev = current
            current = current.next

        # If value was not present in the list
        if current is None:
            print("Value not found in the list.")
            return

        # Unlink the node from the list
        prev.next = current.next
        current = None

    def search(self, value):
        """Search for a node by its value."""
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.data == value:
                return True
            current = current.next
        return False

```



### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">2. Hierarchical Data Structures</span>


#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Rooted Trees</span>

A rooted tree is an ADT that can represent a hierarchical collection, in which items are organised into levels. In a rooted tree, only one item (called the root) can be in the top level.

A binary tree is either empty or it consists of an item, called the root, and two binary trees, called the left subtree and the right subtree.

The Height of a rooted tree is the number of levels.
The Depth of a node is counted from the root to the node.

**Operations:**
* New
* Join
* Root
* Left
* Right
* Is Empty

The binary tree data structure follows the recursive definition: a tree node has an item and points
to two children nodes. A binary tree is like a bifurcating linked list.

```Python
class Tree:
    """A rooted binary tree"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def is_empty(tree: Tree) -> bool:
    """Return True if and only if tree is empty."""
    return tree.root == tree.left == tree.right == None

def join(item: object, left: Tree, right: Tree) -> Tree:
    """Return a tree with the given root and subtrees."""
    tree = Tree()
    tree.root = item
    tree.left = left
    tree.right = right
    return tree

EMPTY = Tree()
THREE = join(3, EMPTY, EMPTY)
FOUR = join(4, EMPTY, EMPTY)
FIVE = join(5, EMPTY, EMPTY)
SIX = join(6, EMPTY, EMPTY)

TPM = join('*', join('+', THREE, FOUR), join('-', FIVE, SIX)) # (3+4)*(5-6)
PMT = join('+', THREE, join('-', join('*', FOUR, FIVE), SIX)) # 3+((4*5)-6)
MPT = join('-', join('+', THREE, join('*', FOUR, FIVE)), SIX) # (3+(4*5))-6

def is_leaf(tree: Tree) -> bool:
    """Return True if and only if the tree is a single leaf."""
    return not is_empty(tree) and is_empty(tree.left) and is_empty(tree.right)

def size(tree: Tree) -> int:
    """Return the number of nodes in tree."""
    if is_empty(tree):
        return 0
    else:
        return size(tree.left) + size(tree.right) + 1
```

## <span style="font-family: Monaco;"> Abstract Data Types Overview (ADTs) </span>

A collection ADT specifically represents a group of elements where the main operations involve:
- Adding elements
- Removing elements
- Accessing elements
- Checking if elements exist

Abstract data types (ADTs) are called "abstract" because they define the behavior and operations of a data structure (such as insertion, deletion, and access) independently of any specific implementation. While the implementation of an ADT can vary depending on the programming language or the underlying data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists), the logical behavior remains consistent. More complex data types are often constructed using simpler ones; for example, a queue can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Therefore you may notice these ADTs _'cross paths'_ in some ways.


**Abstract Data Types:**

    * Collections
        * Ordered Collections
            * sequence
                * string
            * stack
            * queue
            * priority queue
        * Unordered Collections
            * map
            * set
    * Other
            * Tree
            * Graph
            * String

            
Ordered / Unordered collections refers to whether the order of the items within matters to us.

## <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Abstract Data Types (ADTs) in detail</span>

#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Sequences</span>

A sequence is a collection of items in a particular order: one item comes first, another comes second, and so on until the last item. 
Can be mutable or immutable.

**Operations:**
* The indexing operation is written in mathematics as si, for a sequence s and index i. In computing, the more common notation is s[i].
* The membership operation, written v ∈ s or v in s, checks whether value v is an element of sequence s. 
* The comparison operation, written using comparison symbols such as > <. (If the items of a sequence are pairwise comparable each item can be compared to every other item.)
* We also perform operations when creaitng these such as slicing, sorting, and concatonating.

The string ADT is a restricted form of the sequence ADT.

**Example in Python:**
```python
# Creating a list 
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# Creating a tuple 
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0, 30.0)
```
___

#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;"> Stacks </span>
A Stack is a restricted sequence in which new items are added to and removed from only one end of the sequence.

A pile of boxes is a stack. Only the topmost box can be easily accessed. To access any other box, one usually must remove boxes from the top, one by one. To re-form the pile, one must put each box back on top of the previous boxes.

A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) sequence.

**Operations:**
* New
* Size
* Push
* Pop
* Peek
* Is Empty

**Example in Python:**
Stacks can be easily simulated with lists, however it may be harder to identify a list being used as a stack.

```python
class Stack:
    "A last-in, first-out sequence of objects, implemented with a Python list."""

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialise the stack to be empty."""
        self.items = []

    def size(self) -> int:
        """Return the number of items in the stack."""
        return len(self.items)

    def peek(self) -> object:
        """Return the top item in the stack.

        Preconditions: self.size() > 0
        """
        return self.items[-1]

    def pop(self) -> object:
        """Remove and return the top item from the stack.

        Preconditions: self.size() > 0
        """
        return self.items.pop(-1)

    def push(self, item: object) -> None:
        """Put the given item on top of the stack.

        Postconditions: post-self.peek() == item
        """
        self.items.append(item)
```

The stack ADT can also be implemented with the linked list data structure.


```python
class LinkedListStack:
    """A last-in, first-out sequence of objects, implemented with a linked list."""

    class Node:
        """A node in a linked list."""

        def __init__(self, item: object):
            """Initialise the node with the given item."""
            self.item = item
            self.next = None

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialise the stack to be empty."""
        self.head = None
        self.length = 0

    def size(self) -> int:
        """Return the number of items in the stack."""
        return self.length

    def peek(self) -> object:
        """Return the top item in the stack.

        Preconditions: self.size() > 0
        """
        return self.head.item

    def pop(self) -> object:
        """Remove and return the top item from the stack.

        Preconditions: self.length() > 0
        """
        item = self.head.item
        self.head = self.head.next
        self.length = self.length - 1
        return item

    def push(self, item: object) -> None:
        """Put the given item on top of the stack.

        Postconditions: post-self.peek() == item
        """
        node = LinkedListStack.Node(item)
        node.next = self.head
        self.head = node
        self.length = self.length + 1
```


#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Queue</span>

Sequences of items ordered by arrival order, but contrary to stacks, the item arriving first is also the first to be processed: the ‘oldest’ item is at the bottom of the stack but at the front of the queue. 
A queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) sequence: items are removed in the order they arrived.

**Operations:**
* new
* length
* enqueue (add)
* dequeue (remove)
* front

#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Priority Queue </span> 

A priority queue is a sequence of items, each with an associated priority.

 Items are processed from highest to lowest priority value in a **max-priority queue**, and from lowest to highest priority value in a **min-priority queue**. Unless told otherwise, we can’t assume in which order items with the same priority are processed.

 **Operations:**
* new
* length
* insert
* find max/min
* remove max/min

**Example in Python:**
Queues can be simulated with linked lists

```python
class Queue:
    """A last-in, first-out sequence of objects, implemented with a linked list."""

    class Node:
        """A node in a linked list."""

        def __init__(self, item: object):
            """Initialise the node with the given item."""
            self.item = item
            self.next = None

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialise the queue to be empty."""
        self.head = None
        self.last = None
        self.length = 0

    def size(self) -> int:
        """Return the number of items in the queue."""
        return self.length

    def front(self) -> object:
        """Return the item at the front of the queue.

        Preconditions: self.size() > 0
        """
        return self.head.item

    def enqueue(self, item) -> None:
        """Add item to the back of the queue."""
        node = Queue.Node(item)
        if self.length == 0:
            self.head = node
            self.last = node
        else:
            self.last.next = node
            self.last = node
        self.length = self.length + 1

    def dequeue(self):
        """Remove and return the item at the front of the queue.

        Preconditions: self.size() > 0
        """
        item = self.front()
        self.head = self.head.next
        if self.head == None:
            self.last = None
        self.length = self.length - 1
        return item

```


#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Map</span>

A map is an unordered collection of key–value pairs without duplicate keys. Each key–value pair is an item of the map. Different keys may be associated to the same value

**Operations:**
* new
* size
* membership
* associate
* lookup
* delete
* (in)equality

We can write a bespoke hash function for our Map. The hash function is a function that returns the index of a given key.

**Ways to implement a map:**

1. Lookup tables

The simplest way to implement a map is with a **dynamic array** of key-value pairs.
If an array represents a map rather than a sequence, its called a **lookup table**

2. Python Dictionaries

Python’s dict class implements a restricted form of maps.
```python
our_houses= {23: 'Alice', 45: 'Bob'}
```

3. Hash Table

  You can think of a hash table as a specialized type of lookup table that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.
A hash table with seperate chaining is a lookup table with a sequence of key value pairs at each position of the table. A hash table with separate chaining is a specific type of hash table that handles collisions by storing multiple key-value pairs in each bucket using a secondary data structure, typically a linked list.
Each sequence is called a slot of the hash table.

```python
[ # lookup table
[('Carol', 599)], # first slot 
[('Bob', 407), ('Alice', 312)], # second slot
[] # third slot
]
```
**Example in Python:**
Below example uses a dynamic array.
```python
class Map:
    def __init__(self, initial_capacity=10):
        self.capacity = initial_capacity
        self.size = 0
        self.buckets = [None] * self.capacity

    def _hash(self, key):
        return hash(key) % self.capacity

    def _resize(self):
        old_buckets = self.buckets
        self.capacity *= 2
        self.buckets = [None] * self.capacity
        self.size = 0

        for bucket in old_buckets:
            if bucket:
                self.associate(bucket.key, bucket.value)

    # Operation: new
    def new(self):
        return Map(self.capacity)

    # Operation: size
    def get_size(self):
        return self.size

    # Operation: membership

#### <span style="font-family: Monaco;">Set</span>

 A set is an unordered collection of unique items, i.e. without duplicates. The items in a set are traditionally called its elements or members. 
 In mathematics a set is written with curly braces.
 For example, {1, 2, ‘hi’} and {‘hi’, 2, 1} are the same set, as the order in which we list set members doesn’t matter.

**Operatons:**
 * New
 * Size
 * membership (i ∈ s)
 * add
 * remove
 * intersection (s1 ∩ s2)
 * Union (s1 ∪ s2)
 * difference ( s1 − s2)

 Two sets are said to be disjoint if they have no common elements: their intersection is the empty set. 
 Set A is a subset of B, and B a superset of A, written A ⊆ B or B ⊇ A,if every item of A is also in B. 
 Set A is a proper subset of B, written A ⊂ B (or B is a proper superset of A, written B⊃A), if A ⊆ B and A = B.

**Ways to implement a set:**

1. Sequence Data Type

The set ADT can be implemented with a sequence data type, but that makes adding an item take linear time, to check if it’s already there.

2. Pythons Set class

Python has a built-in class set to represent sets. Set literals are written as comma-separated items within curly braces, e.g. {1, 2, 3}.
The last three operations create a new set: they don’t modify either input set.

3. Using a map

A set can be seen as a map from items to Booleans, stating for each item if it’s a member of the set. 
Set operations like intersection are easy to implement by going through two lookup tables and applying Boolean operations.

Python sets are impolemented with Hash tables and therefore must be hashable.

An efficient implementation of a set is very useful: contrary to lists, stacks and queues, it supports the add, remove and membership operations in constant time.
