### White Box Testing
White-box tests, also known as structural tests, have full knowledge of the data structure(s)
used by the data type. 

Structural tests can be written independently for each method, as they can
access the instance variables before and after the method to check they were correctly modified.

### Black Box Testing

Black-box tests, also known as specification-based tests, don’t access the data structures. They test methods based on their defined behaviour. 
A method that changes data can only be tested with methods that inspect data.

Makes regression testing easier. That’s the process of running the same testsafter each change, to make sure the modified code still behaves as before.
