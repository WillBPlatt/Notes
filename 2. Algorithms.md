# Algorithms

An algorithm is an abstraction of steps completed by a computer.\
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that takes some input data and, on completion, produces some output data.

A data type is a collection of values and operations on those values.

Algorithms can be implemented by functions, Inputs for different algorithms can be different data types, so we can use the below template:

TEMPLATE ... for Implementing Algorithms using Functions:

**Function:** the name of the function \
**Inputs:** the name and data type of each input \
**Preconditions:** any conditions on the inputs which are true before the input is applied \
**Output:** the name and data type of the result \
**Postconditions:** how the output relates to the inputs 

The data types must be stated: we can’t assume they’re always real numbers.

EXAMPLE:

**Function:** brick volume \
**Inputs:** length, an integer; width, an integer; height, an integer \
**Preconditions:**
length>0;width>0;height>0
length, width and height are in millimetres \
**Output:** volume, an integer \
**Postconditions:**
volume = length × width × height • volume is in cubic millimetres


The algorithm is correctly implemented if the inputs satisfy the preconditions and the outputs satify the post conditions.


## Complexity

The complexity of an algorithm is often measured by its runtime.
Ideally you want to work this out before you get to code the alogorithm to save time refactoring.
Algorithms can take, for example:
- Linear Time ( grows proportionally with the input size )
- Quadratic Time ( grows proportionally to the square of the input size )
- Exponential Time ( The running time grows exponentially with the input size. This is extremely inefficient )
- Logarithmic Time (The running time increases logarithmically with the input size )
- Cubic time ( The running time increases proportionally to the cube of the input size )
- Constant time ( The running time remains constant regardless of the input size. An algorithm that executes a fixed number of operations each with constant complexity, has constant complextity)
- Sublinear (running time grows slower than linear but faster than logarithmic )
- Superlinear - ( The running time grows faster than linear but slower than polynomial )

There are 3 types of notation we can represent complexity of a function with called **Asymptonic Notation**:
- Big O Notation
- Big Omega Notation
- Big Theta Notation

Big O notation is more about the worst case, so the idea that one function is an upper bound of another function.
Big omega is more about the best case, so the idea that one function is the lower bound of another function.
Big theta is more about the typical case, so the idea that two functions grow at the same rate.
They indicates that an algorithm’s run-time is proportional to ...something... as the input approached infinity.
It's concerned with that happens to f(n) as n gets larger.

The | symbol is often used in computing to denote the length or magnitude of something. For example, |x| means the absolute value of x, while |A| might represent the number of elements in a set A.



## Algorithm Styles

1. Procedural
- Algorithms made of instructions assembled in:
    - **Sequence** - instructions one after another
    - **Selection** - alternative sets of instructions
    - **Iteration** - repeats sets of instructions




## Linear Search Algorithm

The linear search algorithm simply goes through all the indices of the text and stops when it finds the character.
